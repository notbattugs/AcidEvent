        <p1 className="font-bold text-4xl py-12">Webflow</p1>
        <p1 className="font-medium text-lg py-4">
          We used Webflow to create this website. Webflow is a product of
          Webflow, Inc., located at 398 11th Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco,
          CA 94103.
        </p1>
        <p1 className="font-medium text-lg py-4">
          Webflow operates as a Software as a Service (SaaS) application that
          allows designers to create responsive websites using browser-based
          visual editing software. Webflow automatically generates HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript. Webflow also offers the option to export website code
          and host it on an external server, separate from the Webflow hosting
          infrastructure.
        </p1>
        <p1 className="font-medium text-lg py-4">
          In the course of using Webflow, personal data of the website user is
          transferred to the United States and processed there. On July 10,
          2023, the European Commission issued an implementing decision pursuant
          to Article 45(1) of the GDPR regarding the adequacy of the level of
          protection for personal data under the EU-US Privacy Shield framework.
          Based on this decision, data controllers can transfer personal data to
          certified companies and organizations in the United States without the
          need for appropriate safeguards, additional measures, or reliance on
          specific derogations. The US Department of Commerce has published a
          list of US companies that have self-certified to the Department and
          committed to complying with the principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield
          framework. Webflow is certified accordingly and is listed on this
          roster. For more information, please visit:
          https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/.
        </p1>
        <p1 className="font-medium text-lg py-4">
          To ensure data protection-compliant processing, a contract for data
          processing with Webflow was concluded based on Art. 28 GDPR in
          conjunction with the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
        </p1>
        <p1 className="font-medium text-lg py-4">
          The legal basis for processing personal data in the context of using
          Webflow is Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR
        </p1>
        <p1 className="font-medium text-lg py-4">
